# PythonCalculator

# This is a simple calculator that takes integer or decimal numbers and performs some simple calculations as required.
# A good feature in this calculator is its ability to perform calculations using signs as input (e.g. +, *, /, etc..) or
# words instead (e.g. plus, multiplied by, modulus, etc..)
# For example: the user can enter (5 + 3) or (5 plus 3). And the output will be identical for both cases: 5 + 3 = 8
